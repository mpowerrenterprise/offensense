## Introduction

An AI-powered real-time speech analyzer has been developed to identify and manage offensive language during live conversations. This advanced system consists of two essential components: the Management App and the Monitoring App. 

The Management App is the nerve center, providing a user-friendly interface to evaluate detection data, administer corrective actions, and seamlessly incorporate new offensive language patterns. The Management App constantly analyzes real-time audio streams to identify swiftly and flag instances of offensive language.  

This innovative solution enhances the efficiency of moderating live interactions and offers a comprehensive and adaptive approach to addressing evolving linguistic nuances.
